# 🚗 FPGA Automotive Subsystems Control Suite

A collection of synthesizable, hardware-level automotive control modules designed in **Verilog/SystemVerilog** for FPGA deployment. This suite implements safety-critical vehicle dynamics, engine protection, dynamic aerodynamics, and driver assistance logic alongside modular self-checking testbenches.

Detailed design calculations, block diagrams, and state machine specifications are documented in [`docs/project_report.pdf`](docs/project_report.pdf).

## 🌟 ECU Subsystems Overview

### 1. 🛑 Anti-lock Braking System (ABS) & Traction Control
* **Wheel Slip Calculation:** Computes real-time slip ratios by comparing wheel speed metrics against vehicle velocity.
* **PWM Torque Management:** Generates dynamic Pulse-Width Modulation (PWM) signals to reduce engine torque or regulate braking during wheel slip or lockup.

### 2. 🛡️ Smart RPM Limiter & Engine Protection
* **Over-Rev Safeguard:** Tracks real-time engine RPM metrics and triggers automatic safety cut-offs when reaching critical thresholds.
* **Safety State Machine:** Enforces soft-limits during abnormal operational or thermal states.

### 3. 🏎️ Dynamic Active Spoiler System
* **Speed-Dependent Deployment:** Finite State Machine (FSM) that adjusts rear aerodynamic spoiler angle based on vehicle speed stages.
* **Emergency Air-Brake:** Maximizes downforce dynamically under hard deceleration events.

### 4. 🅿️ Advanced Ultrasonic Parking Assist
* **Proximity Calculation:** Reads echo timing signals from ultrasonic sensors to determine obstacle distance.
* **Dynamic Alerting:** Triggers progressive visual and audible alert patterns based on distance zone boundaries.
### 5. ⚙️ Multi-Mode Drive Controller
* **Selectable Drive Maps:** Maps pedal/throttle input to target duty cycles across Eco, Normal, Sport, and Track modes via custom lookup tables (LUTs).
* **Rate-Limited Throttle Transitions:** Implements synchronous slewing rate-limiters to prevent abrupt power spikes, ensuring smooth transitions and drivetrain protection.
* **Traction Control Interfacing:** Exposes real-time duty cycle metrics directly for dynamic torque management integration.
